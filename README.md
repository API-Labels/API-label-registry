# API Label Registry

This is the repository and registry for API labels. It keeps track of registered API label types, and of the value spaces associated with these registered API label types.

Each *API label type* is represented by a *top-level folder in this repository*, with the folder name representing the API label type name. API label type names are strings containing ASCII characters, numbers, and hyphens. They must be treated as being case-insensitive.
